Ford didn't earn a goddamn thing he had the presidency handed to him on a shit-stained platter, and in the process, he managed to piss off just about fucking everyone: his party, the public, and anyone dumb enough to believe this country still had its shit together.<br><br>Now Ford's stuck in the big chair he didn't fucking earn, wallowing in Nixon's stench while trying to govern a nation that doesn't trust his sorry ass. The next two years will decide if he can scrape together even a shred of fucking dignity or just drag his party down in flames for the '76 election.

For most of his career, people thought he was a decent guy, a man of integrity. But when shit fucking hit the fan, he didn't have the fucking balls to live up to that fucking reputation. After Nixon blew the country to hell with fucking Watergate, the nation was desperate for accountability. The people wanted the fucking bastard punished, but the fucking political machine had other plans.<br><br>And then the \"Republican\" Party came up with a brilliant fucking idea: hand fucking idiot Ford the fucking presidency on a fucking silver platter, and in return, he'd pardon Nixon's lying, criminal ass. Ford wiped the slate clean for the biggest goddamn crook in American history, spitting in the face of every American who wanted justice. Accountability? Dead and buried. Trust in government? Gone to shit. But hey, it's all worth it for \"healing the nation,\" right, Gerald? Fuck that.",
