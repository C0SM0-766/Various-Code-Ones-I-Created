Blaine, in a campaign increasingly marred by personal scandals.<br><br>• Cleveland will seek to bring his reputation for reforrn to a national stage, while defending himself from attacks on his character and avoiding conflict with Democratic bosses.<br><br>• Blaine must use his charisma to corner his opponent on issues like tariffs, while attempting to clear himself from long-time accusations of corruption, to ensure a Republican victory.",
