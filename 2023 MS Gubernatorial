The average lifespan is shorter than anywhere else in the country, the average income is lower, and the education system is struggling. To make matters worse, the capital, Jackson, recently experienced a traumatic water crisis, leaving residents without clean running water for days.<p>Perhaps this shouldn't come as a shock. Since the end of the Civil War, those in higher positions have largely neglected the state. Local politicians seem indifferent to improving the situation. Could a new figure emerge to bring about change?</p>",

It's fitting, then, that another Presley family member would step forward, pledging to lead Mississippi out of poverty. Much like his famous cousin, Brandon Presley came from humble beginnings. Born into poverty in Northern Mississippi, he rose through the ranks of local politics to get to where he is today.<p>Despite his compelling story and connection to The King, Presley faces a significant political challenge. Mississippi hasn't elected a Democrat to a statewide office since the '90s and remains deeply conservative. If Presley is to become the next governor, he will need to convince the people of Mississippi that he is not a coastal elite but a modern-day moderate.</p>",

He criticized Reeves for refusing to expand Medicaid, arguing that it puts dozens of rural hospitals at risk of closure and leaves 300,000 Mississippians without health care.
