From giving it to the dirty left, mass deportation of rapists that would put daddy Stalin to shame, repealing an already ambiguous centrist tainted healthcare plan, so on and so forth, there hasn't been a thing Trump has promised to do while failing to deliver. With an equal rowdy foreign policy that make's Dubya's seem tame in comparison, 2024 is shaping out to be a tough match for the Don if he doesn't get his act together. With the social fascists pouncing on him, it's going to take a hail marry for him to come out on top, and this time, a small loan of a million dollars ain't getting him nowhere.</div>","image_url":"https://media.wired.com/photos/5e6a68397c07c90008d0525b/master/w_960,c_limit/Science_trump_1206667167.jpg","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://i.postimg.cc/s2wXz3Zz/20240502-224027.jpg","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":20,"year":2016,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"2020 - The Battle For America's Soul"}];e.credits = "u/SteveFrom_Target.
