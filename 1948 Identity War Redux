Born and raised on a farm in Iowa, Wallace has been a editor for his father's newspaper, a journalist, and a politcal activist. He has later served in the Roosevelt administration as Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce. Then, Vice President under his friend, Franklin Roosevelt. His understanding and work helping the farmer, labor unions, and the common man are all entrenched in his mind.<br><br>However, it wasnâ€™t supposed to be this way. When he entered office after the death by stroke of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Henry A. Wallace had high hopes. But these have long since vanished. He's perhaps the worst man at the worst time. His uncompromising Progressivism on unionization and civil rights has deeply angered the minds of the southern bloc of his party, as well the Republicans, who have decided the nominate the reactionary man in the Senate, Robert Taft.<br><br>It seems that Wallace shan't go through with the election. Polls show Taft winning most of the states, with Byrd winning most of the south, and Wallace mustn't risk just embarrassing himself. But no. His years of work fighting for the common will be washed away, along with Roosevelt's legacy. And so, he'll run again, taking risks, attacking Taft & Byrd, and defending his image. All in the name not only securing four more years in the White House, but also, truly, making this century for the common man.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>","color_hex":"#284ab0","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://files.catbox.moe/beco6x.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":true}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1002,"fields":{"first_name":"Robert A.","last_name":"Taft","election":12,"party":"Republican","state":"Ohio","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><i>It defies all common sense to send that roughneck ward politician back to the White House.</i><br><br>Robert Alphonso Taft didn't get his nickname, Mr. Republican, for no reason.
