Oh, hey there! Didn't expect you to lurk around my Github repository, but I kinda should've expected that when I had put my Github account on Discord.

These are just a bunch of code 1s I created over my time in the NCT code 1 maker. I have no intention of making any of these into full-on mods, nor will I attempt to do such a feat.

I'm disheartened by the amount of amazing mods that were unfortunately canceled. Abyss '76, 2024-Way, 1948 Identity War Redux, etc. There's also many interesting mod mockups that were made that will most likely never become into fully developed mods. Examples include 2024 Election Theory, 2021 NYC, The Hazbin Trail, & 1976 Byrd.

I found a good way to cope with this: make code 1s for these unfinished mods & mod mockups.

Over time, I generally got used to adding more and more codes, as well as adding in various stuff such as music. I also decided to originally write for some codes and come up with my own ideas. Over time, the quality has gotten exponentially better. The age of the older code 1s is clearly shown.
