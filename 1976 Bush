It's seems to be a landslide for the Democrats, like it was in 1964. But Bush knows it wouldn't.

All these words describe George Herbert Walker Bush. In spite of Goldwater getting blown out in Texas, that year saw a novice Bush defeat Senator Yarborough in the largest upset of the night. At the 1968 Republican Convention, he ensured that Texas's slate of 59 Delegates would go to Richard Nixon. Nixon rewared the young senator with the Vice Presidential slot on the ticket. Bush would follow Nixon in his healthy 1968 win and 50 state landslide in 1972.<br><br>After his son, George W. Bush, came home Vietnam in a flag drapped coffin and was laid to rest next to Robin at the Putnam Cemetery, Bush swore he wouldn't run in 1976. Fate had other plans for Bush.
