It seems that circumstance will not allow him to slip away so easily. Despite urging from his party to step down as standard bearer, recent global tensions, and domestic trouble have led President Henry A. Wallace to reconsider his earlier commitments.<br><br>Although he started his second term with a mandate due to the comeback election of 1948, it was quickly spoiled by failures in the Chinese Civil War and his power struggle with the Republican Congress. Now, once again unpopular, he'll have to test if his last victory was fate or skill.<br><br>As he prepares his final bid for public office, he's reminded of all the attempts against him before- conventions of the past where they tried to take him down, where he always succeeded.

In his opinion, that isn't his fault; he was young, and he listened too much to faulty polling by fools who didn't know as much as they claimed.<br><br>Despite how much he's been set back, Governor Dewey isn't deterred in his dream to become president. Once again, he's a candidate for the White House. With a weak field of minor no-names and detested candidates like Taft and MacArthur, it's no surprise he's won the nomination. For the first time in his career, the general election looks favorable for Dewey. His position as a popular governor contrasts with President Wallace's current weak standing in the court of public opinion. Although his demeanor isn't as warm as it once was, and he himself is no longer so shiny and new, Thomas E.
